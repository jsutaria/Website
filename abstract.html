    <u><strong>Analysis of the Probability Density Functions of Alkaline Rechargeable and Nickel Metal Hydride Batteries</strong></u>
    <p>Jainil Sutaria, 2016</p>
  </div>

<div style="margin-left:2em" align="left">
  <p>Rechargeable batteries are a promising method of achieving energy efficiency, and reducing the use of nonrenewable resources. Rechargeable batteries have a high initial cost when compared to disposable batteries, and must have a reliable life cycle
    to be cost effective. Two of the most common household rechargeable batteries are Rechargeable Alkaline Manganese (RAM) and Nickel Metal-Hydride batteries (NiMH). In order to analyze their life cycles and failure rates, a probability density function
    was calculated and their Weibull distributions determined. After performing charge-discharge cycling and achieving a time to a failure of 2000 Joules, a ß value of 2.100 for the RAM batteries, and 5.211 for the NiMH batteries was calculated. The RAM
    ß value of 2.100 represents a largest-flaw failure, in which the batteries are failing, not due to continuous discharge, but a flaw found in the internal chemistry or structure of the battery. For the NiMH batteries, 5.211 demonstrates a near-normal
    distribution, in which the batteries have a short life cycle, yet their failure are more predictable, making them a better replacement for disposable batteries. This research is significant because it suggests that improvements upon rechargeable batteries
    would allow for their extended usage, and the user to achieve the cost saving benefits of rechargeable batteries.</p>
